Happiness is a notoriously difficult thing to measure. However, we actually can measure this through a series of socio-economic indicators. The World Happiness Report is issued annually by a partnership of Gallup, Oxford Wellbeing Research Centre, UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network, and the World Happiness Report's Editorial Board. The annual publication ranks countries based on a survey of people's happiness and quality of life.  The question at hand is how various factors such as GDP, life expectancy, perceptions of corruption, etc. influence citizens' happiness. This would be useful information to government officials, who would use these insights to shape policies that prioritize factors contributing to happiness.
